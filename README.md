# lead-score-assignment

An Education company selling online courses to professionals. The company gets leads in two ways. One way is Professionals landing on the company website who either fill up the form with email and phone and watch relevant videos. The other way is through referrals. The
company receives lots of leads but the lead conversion rate is very poor (30%). The objective is to identify the hot leads who are likely to be converted, so the lead conversion rate gets better by building a classification model (logistic regression model) and assign a lead score. Higher the lead score, higher the chances of it being a hot lead. The target lead score conversion rate must be around 80%.
